# The-state-of-art-of-Dynamic-Global-Illumination-in-video-games
This is my research work on the state-of-art of Dynamic Global Illumination in video-games that I did during the summer of 2021 for my 1st year at Cnam-ENJMIN.

In this article, I discuss the different methods used in the video game industry to achieve dynamic global illumination, giving you a brief explanation of how they work and listing their pros and cons.

Methods covered :

- Screen Space Global Illumination (SSAO, SSDO)
- Light propagation volumes
- Voxel Global Illumination
- RTX Global Illumination
- Irradiance fields (Using RTX or SDF primitives)
- Unreal Engine 5 - Lumens
